            it starts with a spark, and everything you know changes.<br><br>
                
            An understanding that your existence will never be the same.<br><br>
                
            You ignite, you're actualized.<br><br>
                
            More important than any relationship, more important than any thankless goal aimed to stroke the capitalist structures that surppress us all.<br><br>
                
            Communication without words. <br><br>
                
            The exchanges of emotional understanding like magic. <br><br>
                
            You're realized. <br><br>
            
            An artist.</p>

            <p class="artistBlockText">Fast forward to hustling (in the most exposed, vulnerable sense) for a space in the world in which you invested a lifetime.  Barely staying afloat financially.  Working however many 'flexible' side jobs you can find.  Putting up with the industry's toxic urgency and unrealistic demands.  Being told again and again there is no place for you.  Holding your breath and hoping for a 'chance'.<br><br>

            This abuse on the confidence and identity of artsts causes many to forget why they started, and that life altering spark goes out.</p>

            <p class="artistBlockText">Education is important, but greater transparency is needed.  For most, the capital investment will vastly outweigh the return.  We can't take our artist's futures by saddling them with unmanageable debt.<br><br>
            
            The amount of opportunity you receive in the industry is not reflective of your value or relevance as an artist.<br><br>

            We cannot kill our artists by forcing them to be everything all at once.  We are expected to be sound engineers, video editors, lighting designers, PR specialists, social media gurus, marketing geniuses - the list goes on and on.  It's OK to simply want to do the work.<br><br>

            We are in the 'busines' of ideas.  How do we as a society monetize an idea?  Is it working for ALL of our artists? </p>

            <p class="artistBlockText"> We need to make space for our artists to doster their unique sparks and DO WHAT THEY WERE FUCKING BORN TO DO.<br><br>

            We need to offer healing perspectives in the midst of one of the biggest mental health crises our world has ever seen.<br><br>

            You are STILL AN ARTIST and what we have to say matters.</p>

            <p class="bottomStatement">Echo is an inclusive, consent-forward community theatre project.  Our focus is to collectively heal as artists - to nurture and protect our spark while navigating late stage capitalism at its most exploitative.  To create thought-provoking, politically relevant work while utilizing multiple modes of artistic expression.</p>
